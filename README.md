# Python Chess Project
Welcome to our Python chess game repository! This project aims to create a single-player chess game against AI, with various difficulty options, visual customization of pieces, and a future local multiplayer mode.

## üéØ Project Objective
Develop a complete and functional desktop chess game using Python, with the following main features:
- Single Player Mode: Player vs. AI (Artificial Intelligence).
- Multiple AI Difficulty Levels:
  - Easy/Medium: Custom AI implementation (Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and custom evaluation function).
  - Hard: Integration with Stockfish chess engine.
- Visual Customization: Using PNG sprites for pieces and board.
- Local Multiplayer Mode: Two players on the same computer (future).
- Intuitive Graphical Interface: Using Pygame.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x: Main programming language.
- Pygame: Library for game development and graphical interface.
- python-chess: Library for chess game logic (moves, validations, board state).
- Stockfish: Open-source chess engine (for "Hard" difficulty mode).

## üìÇ Project Structure
The folder structure was designed for modularity and collaboration:

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup and Installation
Follow the steps below to configure your development environment and install dependencies.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed (we recommend Python 3.8 or higher).
- Git installed.

**Installation Steps**
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasgleria/ai-chess-game.git
cd ai-chess-game
```
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Download Stockfish (for "Hard" AI):
- Go to the official Stockfish website: https://stockfishchess.org/download/
- Download the version compatible with your operating system.
- Extract the Stockfish executable (ex: stockfish.exe on Windows, stockfish on Linux/macOS) and place it in the engines/ folder within your project.
