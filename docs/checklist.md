# ðŸ“‹ General Chess Project Checklist

This is the master checklist that covers all project tasks from start to finish.  
Tasks marked as **"All Together"** are the responsibility of the entire team.

---

## Phase 0: Setup and Initial Planning (**All Together**)

- [x] **0.1 "Hello Pygame" Prototype:** Each developer creates a basic script to test the Pygame environment.
- [x] **0.2 Internal API Design (Overview):** Discussion and definition of main classes and interactions between modules.

---

## Phase 1: Independent Foundation (Parallel)

### Developer A: Core Game Logic & Board Representation

- [x] **1.A.1 Set up python-chess:** Encapsulate `chess.Board()` and basic game methods.
- [x] **1.A.2 Validation and Game State:** Implement methods to check move legality and final game state.
- [x] **1.A.3 Move Representation:** Generate legal moves and convert formats.
- [x] **1.A.4 Unit Tests:** Write tests for game logic.

### Developer B: Visuals, User Interaction & Audio

- [x] **1.B.1 Basic Pygame Setup:** Set up window, main loop, and sizes.
- [x] **1.B.2 Asset Loading and Drawing:** Load piece PNGs and draw board/pieces.
- [x] **1.B.3 Mouse Event System:** Detect clicks and drag/drop, and visual selection feedback.
- [x] **1.B.4 Basic Audio Logic:** Set up mixer and load/test a simple sound.

### Developer C: AI Framework & AI Core Logic

- [x] **1.C.1 AI Interface Definition:** Create base class `BaseChessAI`.
- [x] **1.C.2 "Easy" AI Implementation (Simple Minimax):** Create `EasyAI` with basic evaluation and low-depth Minimax.
- [x] **1.C.3 "Medium" AI Implementation (Minimax with Alpha-Beta):** Create `MediumAI` with more sophisticated evaluation and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- [x] **1.C.4 AI Testing:** Write tests for AI functions.
