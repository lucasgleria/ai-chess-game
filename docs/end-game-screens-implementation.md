# End Game Screens Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of chess-themed end game screens for the AI Chess Game project, specifically addressing task 3.B.2 from the Developer B checklist.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Chess-Themed Visual Design

The end game screens now feature a comprehensive chess theme with:

- **Chess Board Pattern Background**: Alternating brown and cream squares
- **Chess-Themed Colors**: 
  - `CHESS_BROWN` (139, 69, 19) - Dark brown for chess board
  - `CHESS_CREAM` (245, 245, 220) - Light cream for chess board
  - `CHESS_GOLD` (255, 215, 0) - Gold for highlights and checkmate
  - `CHESS_SILVER` (192, 192, 192) - Silver for draws and stalemate
  - `CHESS_DARK` (47, 79, 79) - Dark slate gray for borders
  - `CHESS_LIGHT` (240, 248, 255) - Alice blue for text

### 2. Specific Game End Types

The system now detects and displays specific end game scenarios:

#### Checkmate
- **Title**: "♔ CHECKMATE ♔" in gold
- **Message**: "♔ White King Wins! ♔" or "♚ Black King Wins! ♚"
- **Decorations**: Crown symbols (♔) in gold
- **Color Scheme**: Gold highlights

#### Stalemate
- **Title**: "♗ STALEMATE ♗" in silver
- **Message**: "♗ Game Ended in Stalemate ♗"
- **Decorations**: Bishop symbols (♗) in silver
- **Color Scheme**: Silver highlights

#### Draw Variants
- **Insufficient Material**: "♖ INSUFFICIENT MATERIAL ♖"
- **Fifty-Move Rule**: "♖ FIFTY-MOVE RULE ♖"
- **Repetition**: "♖ REPETITION DRAW ♖"
- **General Draw**: "♖ DRAW ♖"
- **Decorations**: Rook symbols (♖) in silver

#### Time Control
- **Title**: "⏰ TIME'S UP ⏰" in gold
- **Message**: "⏰ White's Time is Up! Black Wins! ⏰"
- **Decorations**: Clock symbols (⏰) in gold

### 3. Interactive Buttons

All buttons feature chess-themed styling with hover effects:

- **Play Again**: "♔ Play Again ♔" with gold border
- **Main Menu**: "♖ Main Menu ♖" with silver border  
- **Exit Game**: "♗ Exit Game ♗" with red border

### 4. Enhanced Detection Logic

The system now uses specific chess library functions to detect game end types:

```python
if chess_game.is_checkmate():
    # Handle checkmate
elif chess_game.is_stalemate():
    # Handle stalemate
elif chess_game.board.is_insufficient_material():
    # Handle insufficient material
elif chess_game.board.is_fifty_moves():
    # Handle fifty-move rule
elif chess_game.board.is_repetition():
    # Handle repetition
```

## Technical Implementation

### File Modifications

1. **`src/main.py`**:
   - Enhanced `draw_end_game_screen()` function with chess theme
   - Improved game end detection logic
   - Added specific handling for different draw types
   - Enhanced time control detection

### Key Functions

#### `draw_end_game_screen(result_text)`
- Creates chess-themed overlay with board pattern
- Determines game end type from result text
- Renders appropriate title, message, and decorations
- Displays interactive buttons with hover effects

#### Enhanced Game End Detection
- Uses `chess_game.is_checkmate()` for checkmate detection
- Uses `chess_game.is_stalemate()` for stalemate detection
- Uses `chess_game.board.is_insufficient_material()` for material draws
- Uses `chess_game.board.is_fifty_moves()` for fifty-move rule
- Uses `chess_game.board.is_repetition()` for repetition draws

## Testing

A test script (`test_end_game_screens.py`) was created to verify all end game scenarios:

- Checkmate (White wins)
- Checkmate (Black wins)
- Stalemate
- Draw by Insufficient Material
- Draw by Fifty-Move Rule
- Draw by Repetition
- Time control scenarios

## Visual Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: All screens follow the same chess theme
2. **Clarity**: Clear distinction between different game end types
3. **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and readable fonts
4. **Interactivity**: Hover effects and clear button states
5. **Thematic**: Chess pieces and symbols throughout the interface

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Animations**: Smooth transitions between game states
2. **Sound Effects**: Different sounds for different end game types
3. **Statistics**: Display game statistics on end screens
4. **Replay Option**: Add option to replay the final moves
5. **Export**: Allow saving game results or sharing

## Checklist Status

✅ **3.B.2 End Game Screens**: 
- Create dedicated screens for "Checkmate", "Draw", "Stalemate" with options for "New Game" or "Exit"
- Implemented with full chess theming and specific detection for all game end types
