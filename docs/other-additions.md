# üìù Other Additions and Developer Notes

This document is intended for developers to record any additions, changes, or observations that are not part of the main project planning. Each developer (A, B, and C) has a dedicated section below. Please use your section to document anything relevant that should be tracked for future reference or team awareness.

## Section for Developer A

- **[Refactoring Done by Dev C - Core Organization]**
  - The main core classes (`ChessGame`, `GameManager`, `MoveValidator`) were moved to separate files within `src/core/`.
  - The core's `__init__.py` file was cleaned up and now only exposes public interfaces, with no implementations.
  - The game entry point was centralized in `main.py`, removing automatic executions from the core.
  - Detailed docstrings were added to each class to facilitate future maintenance and understanding.
  - **Reason:** To follow Python best practices, and to make the project easier to maintain, scale, and test.
  - **Benefit:** More modular, clean code, easier to expand and integrate with other parts of the system.

- **[Extras to Complete Dev A's Phase 1 Checklist by Dev C]**
  - Implemented public utility methods in the `ChessGame` class: `new_game`, `make_move`, `undo_move`, `is_legal_move`, `outcome`, `get_legal_moves`, UCI <-> Move conversion.
  - Created automated tests for the core logic in `tests/test_core.py`, covering: new game, move application/undo, legality checking, end state checking, and move conversion.
  - Structured the `tests/` folder at the project root for test organization.
  - Fixed the `pytest.ini` file to ensure pytest works correctly with `pythonpath=src` and the test folder.
  - Adjusted imports and test logic to ensure compatibility and robustness.
  - **Reason:** To ensure all requirements of Dev A's Phase 1 checklist were robustly, testably, and best-practice aligned.
  - **Benefit:** The project core is now fully covered by automated tests, with clear utility methods and a scalable test structure.
